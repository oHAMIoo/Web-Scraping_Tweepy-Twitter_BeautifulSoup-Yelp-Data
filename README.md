# Web Scraping: Tweepy Twitter | BeautifulSoup Yelp Data

**Scraping Users tweets with Tweepy API**</br>
In this project, I scraped a timeline of tweets and printed each one of the tweets to an excel file.</br>
Note: Twitter requires all requests to use OAuth for authentication. The Authentication requires a user to register with the Twitter Developer Account. I have added token keys from the twitter developer app in order to use this application: Consumer_key, Consumer_secret, Access_token, Access_token_secret
